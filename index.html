<!-- CSS Color Terminology and Definitions
			- Color can be defined in several different ways
				- By color name
				- By RGB (red green blue)
				- By HSL (hue saturation value)
				- By hexidecimal value

				- RGB and HSL have the added option to set transparency via an alpha

	<!-- Color by RGBA - Red | Green | Blue | Alpha
			- RGB mixes three primary colors in levels ranging from 0 to 255
			- Red = 255, 0, 0 | Green = 0, 255, 0 | Blue = 0, 0, 255 | Black = 0 , 0, 0 | White = 255, 255, 255
			- The alpha creates transparency with 0 being fully transparent and 1 being fully opaque

	<!-- Color by HSL - Red | Green | Blue | Alpha
			- HSL mixes color based on hue, saturation, and lightness
				- Hue = the color's position on the color wheel - ranges from 0 to 359
				- Saturation = the color's 'purity' or 'intensity' - ranges from 0% (no color) to 100% (intense color)
				- Lightness = The color's brightness - ranges from 0% (black) to 100% (white)

	<!-- Color by Hexidecimal Value
			- Hexidecimal value uses six combinations of numbers and letters ranging from 0-9 and a-f - ######
			- Red = ff0000 | Green = 00ff00 | Blue = 0000ff | Black = 000000 | white = ffffff
			- Hexidecimal is the most common means of identifying color in web design because it is the most efficient for web browsers
